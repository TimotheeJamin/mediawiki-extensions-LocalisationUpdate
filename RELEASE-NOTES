== LocalisationUpdate 2014.03 ==
Released at 2014-03-31.

LocalisationUpdate is rewritten for JSON file format support for extensions.
This is compatible with MediaWiki 1.19 and above.
* Extensions using JSON are fully supported and LocalisationUpdate will pickup
new languages as they appear.
* LocalisationUpdate will store translation using JSON file format. If
extension is not yet migrated to JSON, messages will be stored as PHP file.

=== Configuration changes ===

==== Global Variables ====

====== $wgLocalisationUpdateRepository ======
Default repository source to fetch translation. MediaWiki's Github mirror is
set to default repository to fetch translations. This is added with version 1.1.

===== $wgLocalisationUpdateRepositories =====
Array of repositories URLs from which to retrieve localisations for core
MediaWiki and extensions. Default is set to GitHub's MediaWiki Git repositories
and you should not change this unless you're using this performance improvement or
otherwise know what you're doing. This is added with version 1.1.

==== Script parameters changes ====
With version 1.1,

 --repoid: Fetch translations from repositories identified by this

==== Notes ====
* Once core MediaWiki switches to JSON format, all users must update LU to keep
receiving updates. They will need to update anyway because older versions of
LocalisationUpdate do not support JSON at all.

* If an extension switches to JSON, we will not be able to provide updates
until its local checkout is updated to such a version. LocalisationUpdate does
not know about the switch and will try to fetch the PHP shim, which does not
have translations any longer. This is usually okay, as the PHP shims support
old MediaWiki versions; problems might appear if the extension has other
incompatible changes which prevent updating.
